If we have received no new data, the \"expired\" layer is not replaced. The layer is replaced as soon as we receive an updated file. Perimeters are usually collected on a daily basis for large fires that are growing. However, there may be gaps in daily coverage.\n",

    "Perimeters are collected in the field by a variety of means, including infrared flights, and by using a GPS unit to map the perimeter. Please NOTE: GeoMAC only displays perimeter data as they are submitted by field offices. Since data are not received for all fires, you may not be able to view perimeters for every fire.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perimeter data displayed in and delivered by the Geomac application is not the final or official perimeter for any incident and is provided for informational purposes only. The final official perimeter should be obtained from the host unit which can be determined by looking at the Unit Id for any specific fire. The host unit is responsible for producing official and final perimeters for all incidents in their jurisdiction.\n",

CAL FIRE/FRAP, the USDA Forest Service Region 5 Remote Sensing Lab, the Bureau of Land Management, and the National Park Service jointly develop the comprehensive fire perimeter GIS layer for public and private lands throughout California.\n",
